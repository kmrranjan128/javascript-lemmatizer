 overview of Aetna banking application.
-------------------------------------------
-> Aetna is a one of the fastest growing health insurence domain company.they are selling 
   self-insured plans to the small groups.due to high data volumes and other factors,aetna 
   want to develop a new application named aetna banking application which is more effective.
-> basically Aetna is providing the healthcare policies to the customers and ABA is managing 
   the billing reports kind of activities for aetna & customers (policy holder).
-> main purpose of this application is to provide health insurence to the customer and also 
   update the status of customer renewal poliies.like(medical billing,patient engagement,
   health records etc).
-> it keeps the information of the cusomers,customers bank information,contract period and 
   invoice related informaion.there are diff modules in this project as customer enrollment,
   adding bank information,invoice generation,report generation and billing.

-> currently under ABA we have six projects:
   1> ABA - UI
   2> ABA - Service
   3> ABA - Batch
   4> ABA - Notification Service
   5> ABA - Reporting tool
   6> ABA - Data migration.

-> first five of them are developed by cognizant and the data migration is handled by infosys.
-> there are three teams that handle the five projects.and each team have 7 members working
   and all team are assigned with equal story points for every sprint release.

 1.> ABA batch.
---------------------
-> ABA batch is mainly used to perform bulk related operations on regular interval basis.
   it is used for tranfering funds among different account by Aetna and also to generate different 
   reports on given internal like every month,week or last buisness day of the month etc.
-> to work with batch related task we are using spring batch.
-> we have one major batch job that manage all transactions related task is NACHA process.
-> Nacha process consists of so many steps some important and well known as -
   1.> prenote transaction - it includes bank account validation for the customers.
   2.> Invoice/payment plan - it is one time payment plan.it will run once for each customer on every months.
       payment plan - it is for installment plan.
   3.> Revenue Transaction - it will debit from AFA account to aetna revenue account.
   4.> SAMP Transaction - it will debit from AFA to samp account.it will happened when claim comes.

  2.> ABA service
---------------------
-> it is basically a web application. it has their own interactice UI designed by using angular6.
-> through this web application we can manage all the functionlities like : 
   1.> managing customers.
   2.> managing customers contracts (agreement between company and plansponsor.it is for 12 months.
   3.> managing customers bank informations
   4.> managing customers bill package.

 1.> managing customers
------------------------------
-> As part of this feature,we can add cutomers to ABA and we can perform view and edit operations.
-> to manage these operations,we have dedicated seperate controller to get the request and send back the response.
-> And we have respective service,DTO, and DAO layer to manage buisness and database requirements.

 2.> managing customers contracts
--------------------------------------
-> here we are managing contract for customers.and customer can have more than one different contract.
-> contract is nothing but one policy.each contract is having some tenure i.e start and end date.and 
   contract end date is less than current date then that particular contracts has to be terminated.

 3.> managing customers bank informations
------------------------------------------
-> here we are managing customers bank account information.

 4.> managing customers bill package.
--------------------------------------
-> here we are managing bill package.there are different bill packages are that helps customer 
   to select according to thier needs.
-> plansponsor has some policy under which it provide the insurence to cover the members or group 
   of members.each member has seperate bills and the collection of bill is called as bill package.

 -> NACHA Process (payment gateway process) :- it is a batch process.it is group of transactions.
   it contains four types of records:-
   a> prenote - validate the bank account of a customer.
   b> payment plan/invoice - it will pull whole premium amount from customer account to AFA account.
      it is a daily activity as per the draft date.
   c> revenue account - 
   d> SAMP - it ia claim account.
   e> DIP File - it is acknowledgement for success transaction.
   f> RIP file - for fail transaction.again it will go for revise.it is a batch job.
   g> Late fees- it will add the fine for the customers who has not paid the payment on time.

   1> tranfer amount from customer bank account to aetna bank account.
   2> tranfer amount from aetna bank account aetna revenue bank account.
   3> tranfer amount from aetna bank account to aetna CRS bank account.
   

-> under ABA we have some important components such as -
   EBS, SFDC - through which the customers and other customer related information coming into the ABA.
   SFDC - it contains the customer information or customer claims.
   EBS - enterprise billing system.it can have billing related information of customers.
   SFDC + EBS = ABA


-> the main purpose of this application is to pull & push the money between the bank accounts.
-> pulling money from customer bank account to aetna bank account.for this purpose,the customers
   bank details like customer name,PSUID,control number,and bank details like account number
   routing number details are taken from the SFDC(it contains customer information and customer claims).

-> All the details including the invoice due amount and all the invoice details are given to EBS.
   EBS(enterprise billing system) it contains billing related information.
   it has two reports :-
   1> Triad report - BP details (BP Number,PSUID, Control Number).
   2> LL Report - invoice details (Invoice Number, Invoice amount,BP NUMBER,PSUID,Control number).
-> invoice amount is calculated and due date is given every month for the customers.due date is different
   from the draft date.
-> draft date is the date when the transaction is actually drafted and details are sent to the CITI bank 
   to process the transaction using a NACHA file which has a certain format and is sent as per the schedule
   to the bank.it is uploaded on one of our servers and CITI would hit the servers and access it.


 terminology
---------------
-> termination date - date on which the contract of the customer should be terminated and to be active the
   customer needs to go ahead and renew the policy.
-> contract period - the period in which a policy of a customer ia active.
-> constent form - forms stored in the fileNet and contain information of the customer and the bank details.
-> PSUID - plan sponsor uniqeid.
-> control number - number that is given to a group of people coming under one criterion.

	2) Controller Layer [handles http methods and contains endpoints]

	3) Service Layer [business classes]
		-business logic
		-Composition and Decomposition of business objects
		-Security

	4) Model Layer [Spring JDBC | Spring HIBERNATE | Spring JPA | Spring DATA]
		-Data classes / POJOs
