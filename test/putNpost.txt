PUT:
->It is usually modelled as an insert or update. 
->But mostly it used for Update operation only but not for insert. 
->In order to update a resource we need to send the identity as part of the PUT req.
->It is idempotent because sending the same PUT message more than once has no effect on the underlying service.
->For example if we wanted to update the order we need to send the order-id and to do this update we need to 
  send PUT request with order-id over the URL.


POST:
->It is used to create a new resource.
->POST is the only Non-Idempotent and unsafe operation of HTTP.
->Each POST method is allowed to modify the service in a unique way that means always it will creates a new 
 resource for each and every req in the server side hence it is not Idempotent. 

->For Example if we are creating account for first time we can use post method.but if we want to update our 
account information then we have to send that account-no with the request;so here we can use put.
